	<p>The Gothic-style architecture, for the development of modern ideas, is welcomed and embraced in a way, if anything, to become at least a sweet sister to the monumental architecture of Lazio; to that architecture that often shone and of which we admire ancient and recent pompous buildings.
 And quite rightly modern architects focus their attention on the first, even if it shows off its style in the magnificent and venerable cathedrals of Germany, France, England, etc.
: which form the wonder and amazement of all those who feel and see well in terms of beautiful architecture; therefore, the monuments of the Middle Ages gradually vary with the most intense application, studying from intelligent and learned people, the merits and beauties of Gothic architecture are increasingly discovered with growing pleasure.

Assuming, even with Gessner's desire, that an artist, driven by their love for art, spends their happiest hours creating and dreams of their favorite work at night, they can only reach their glorious goal and occupy an eminent position if they have materials to fuel their passion and give it growth.
 It is for this reason that amidst the abundance of collections, compilations, studies of architecture and ornaments that exist, it is believed that one of the collections that best meets the needs of artists and tastes, and therefore worthy of being reproduced with illustrative references translated into our language, is the Collection of Selected Ornaments and Gothic Architecture Profiles by the architect Carlo cav.
 Heideloff.
 At another time, the Principles of Gothic Style by Mr.
 Federico Iloffstadt were published, with an Italian translation by Professor cav.
    <p>Francesco Lazzari achieved the most brilliant outcome with this work; to this work can follow the present collection of ornaments by Cav.
 Heideloff, because while the former exhibits and successfully develops the fundamental principles of art, the latter excessively relies on the aesthetic part, offering the most selected details, not only useful for architects, but also for sculptors, casters, instigators, cabinetmakers, etc .
: while, in addition to the purely architectural parts, the collection is enriched with specimens of monuments, various sacred and domestic furnishings, gentilic coats of arms, etc.
 The utility of this enterprise seemed very interesting to me, since the most distinguished talents dedicate themselves to the study of this kind of architecture that has now spread its productions throughout all parts of the civilized world.
